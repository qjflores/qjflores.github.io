# Travel and Perspective

At the time of this writing, I've been travelling for the past 51 months.

If you asked me 10 years ago is this what I would be doing with my life, I would have looked at you a bit cock eye'd and refernced Tupac, "living and dying in LA".

I haphazardly discovered that travel provided me with perspective. That I had died and had been reborn in India, in Cambodia, Japan, in every village, temple and market I passed through. And that every experience made me a little bit more tolerable, a little bit more patient, and a little bit wiser.


Slowly the narrow minded, idealistic principles that had once provided a foudation of existence started to fade with each step on that unnamed road to that unknown location.


Eventually that unamed road, the Samsara, ends.
